# Inverse of Scara-Robot
This is the algorith to get the inverse Kinematics of a SCARA Robot, using a Geometrical Approach.
The validation was done on Matlab with 100 000 iterations, to get a pair of two solutions, this works, for all the position, but when y=0, we can found 4 solutions, were only two are touched.
